# Nose tests #

Write 5 test cases for `../acp_times.py` in `test_acp_times.py`. Remeber: you have to write them based on the original website.

Write 2 test cases for `../mypymongo.py` in `test_mypymongo.py`. Remeber: you have to write them based on the original website.

Also remember you must run the tests from the parent directory to access `acp_times` and `mypymongo`. You can just use `run_tests.sh` for that, like in project 3.
